&lt;p&gt;I wanted to move to a more Ruby friendly IDE… RubyMine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this guide from the RubyMine Documentation: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/configuring-remote-interpreters-using-wsl.html#wsl_remote&quot;&gt;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/configuring-remote-interpreters-using-wsl.html#wsl_remote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem I had was the mapping between the Windows file system and the Linux one - step 6 in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem seemed to be that the mappings didn’t work when access the UNC shares for WSL 2. For example the UNC path for this blog is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\\wsl\Ubuntu\home\cchild\repos\hardcopy.dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way around this is to map a network drive to the UNC path and us that for the mappings in RubyMine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up doing one mapping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;U:&lt;/code&gt; —&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;rubymine-wsl-mapping.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rubymine WSL 2 Mapping&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this is useful.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to do when your Unraid flash drive dies...]]></title><description><![CDATA[My Unraid flash drive has died again this week - it lasted about 3 months this time.

The only way I knew it had died is that I was missing all the CSS when logging in and there were some strange PHP errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the first time, I had no backups of the flash drive at all - yes, I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did learn from my mistake and this time I have backups - but this is still a pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps to fix are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new Unraid USB using the Unraid Flash Utility which can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unraid.net/download&quot;&gt;Unraid website&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to use the same version you had installed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screenshot the main array page in Unraid if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power down and swap the USB drives over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the procedure to replace the flash drive found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.unraid.net/UnRAID_6/Changing_The_Flash_Device&quot;&gt;Unraid Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. This process will email you a brand new registration key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy everything in the config folder over to the new USB drive from your backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here I had to reconfigure the whole array, so use the screenshot from before to make sure it is exactly the same as before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the array and any services you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you might want to check everything is working as expected. It was a few days before I realized one of my user scripts was not running! Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two Pro keys, which is good because you can only replace your key every 12 months. If I only had one I might be in a pickle&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Setting Up Gatsby]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am moving from a Wordpress site and converting all my old posts.

Which is not that many!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Gatsby as I have done a lot of work with React over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole install process was very straight forward. You will need node and npm. I won’t go into details here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the Gatsby Blog Starter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&lt;/a&gt;. This means you can use the following command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which will create a new directory (blog) and scaffold out a pretty good blog template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then all you need to do is run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby develop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which will open up a dev instance on port 8000 by default. &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy blogging!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Entity Framework Core - Create Entities from Database]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recently needed to access a database with EF Core from a console application.

&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/powershell&quot;&gt;EF Core Tools&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish this. First install the EF Core Tools, run this command in the Package Manger Console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the required tools installed you can scaffold the DbContext and enties using the following command. Substitute the database details and required tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Scaffold-DbContext \&amp;quot;Server=SERVER;Database=DATABASE;Trusted_Connection=True;\&amp;quot; Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models -Tables TABLE_1, TABLE_2 -Context Context -Force&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The -Force flag will overwrite any existing files. This is useful if you want to add an extra table later on. Keep in mind you will need to specify all the tables the second time. The process will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; update the context, but rather overwrite it. So if you miss any tables the second time you will be unable to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option which I think is quite useful is the ContextDir flag, this allows you to specify an alternative location for the DbContext, by default this class will be located along with the Models/Entites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[You can't use a 102 http status code in Azure]]></title><description><![CDATA[You can’t use a 102 status code because Azure will always wait for a follow up code.

In my code I changed it to a 202 Accepted instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try and use a 102 in Azure, you will eventually get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/502&quot;&gt;502 response&lt;/a&gt;, which states that the server received an invalid response while acting as a proxy or gateway. Which translates to, I received a 102 but not a final status code from you code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 102 should only ever be used to say that the call is still in progress ans must always be followed up with a final status code, be that a 200 or 202 like I changed mine to.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ReSharper 2019.1.2 and Visual Studio 2019 Code Completion/Smart Tag Conflicts + Fix]]></title><description><![CDATA[Not 100% sure when this started, but I eventually got annoyed by Visual Studio and ReSharper having a different keyboard shortcuts for…]]></description><link>https://hardcopy.dev/resharper-201912-and-visual-studio-2019-code-completionsmart-tag-conflicts-fix/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://hardcopy.dev/resharper-201912-and-visual-studio-2019-code-completionsmart-tag-conflicts-fix/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2019 10:49:18 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Not 100% sure when this started, but I eventually got annoyed by Visual Studio and ReSharper having a different keyboard shortcuts for potential code fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReSharper is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Alt + Enter&lt;/code&gt; Visual Studio is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CTRL + .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio was warning for some potential code problems and I want ReSharper to handle it all. Specifically it was the “Expression value is never used” warning, which wants you to &lt;em&gt;discard&lt;/em&gt; the return value using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/discards&quot;&gt;_ C# 7.0 discard&lt;/a&gt;. It gets annoying not knowing which keyboard shortcut the squiggle wants.\n\nSo eventually I found the setting, which is in the ReSharper settings rather than Visual Studio settings. In Visual Studio 2019 the exact location is as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Extensions —&amp;gt; ReSharper —&amp;gt; Options —&amp;gt; Code Inspection —&amp;gt; Settings —&amp;gt; Merge Visual Studio Light Bulb actions into ReSharper bulb.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a setting here that will allow you to hide the Visual Studio squiggles - I did not find this useful, as when enabled you miss some suggestions even though using the keyboard shortcut with your cursor at the location will give you the same menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enabling this setting, you can now use either of the above shortcuts and you get a merged menu of all options - much better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope somebody finds this helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SSH in Windows 10]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the first in a series of posts I am calling “Did You Know”.

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can now use SSH directly in the Windows command prompt. I did not until just the other day. I normally use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.putty.org&quot;&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;, which has always served me well. But it is much easier to use command prompt, especially as I quite often use lots of different machines and I constantly have to re-download PuTTY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax is very much as you would expect. So to connect to my router at home I use the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ssh root@192.168.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;2019-02-01-11_05_05-Command-Prompt-ssh-root@192.168.0.1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Putty SSH&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also specify a different port using the -p flag. For example, to connect to my router using port 4567, you would use the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ssh root@192.168.0.1 -p 4567&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple as that, you can now quickly connect to your Linux machines without the need for PuTTY.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MSSQL NOLOCK - my comments and its problems]]></title><description><![CDATA[Let me start by saying I’m not a SQL expert or a database admin. Don’t get me wrong I have written my fair share for SQL and stored…]]></description><link>https://hardcopy.dev/mssql-nolock/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://hardcopy.dev/mssql-nolock/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 14:31:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying I’m not a SQL expert or a database admin. Don’t get me wrong I have written my fair share for SQL and stored procedures, so I’m no novice either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told at work that we have a policy of always using NOLOCK and ROWLOCK when reading or writing to a table. At first I didn’t really question this, but one day I decided to look into what exactly NOLOCK was and when it should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed strange to me that if it was best practice to use it all the time, why it was not the default lock in SQL Server when performing reads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search later and after reading a few articles, mainly this one on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techrepublic.com/article/using-nolock-and-readpast-table-hints-in-sql-server/&quot;&gt;techrepublic.com&lt;/a&gt;, I came to the conclusion that NOLOCK really shouldn’t be used as the standard way of doing things and here is why…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is NOLOCK?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very basic level NOLOCK is exactly as you would expect, it tells SQL Server not to use any locks on the database. This will increase the performance of your database and if you need a very high performance database, it might well be worth considering the NOLOCK table hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOLOCK is a synonym for the READUNCOMMITTED table hint. They are the exact same thing! The READUNCOMMITTED table hint doesn’t sound quite so appealing does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You mean to tell me, that if I use NOLOCK or READUNCOMMITTED that I can read data that has yet to be committed to my database?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NOLOCK/READUNCOMMITTED dirty read problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use either of the table hints above you run the risk of reading uncommitted data. Let me explain…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I run this SQL statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers WITH(NOLOCK)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the return value is 10, so there are 10 rows in the Customers table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I then run this SQL statement (notice that I have left the transaction open)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;BEGIN TRANSACTION
INSERT INTO Customers (Name)
VALUES (&amp;#39;Chris&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because I have left this transaction open, the database has not yet committed this to the database and as such I should not be able to read the data, correct? If I now run the same count statement as before in a new query window. What would you expect the result to be, 10 because the data hasn;t yet been committed to the database?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers WITH(NOLOCK)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it returns 11 because I have used the NOLOCK table hint, this is a dirty read and happens because we are not issuing a lock on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now normally you don’t leave transactions open like this, but what if you had a very time consuming stored proc? That took say 30 seconds? It is possible for those 30 seconds to read data that is uncommitted. Sure, but after 30 seconds this data is going to get committed, so whats the harm done? Well, what if there is a problem and you want to roll this data back? Any reads taken place using the NOLOCK table hint now have invalid data. I can think of places where this wouldn’t matter, say you need to count the number of comments on a blog post to display to your viewers; does it really matter if that count is out slightly? No, not really. But what if you are calculating some more sensitive data, say in a banking application? The ramifications could be much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The take home points are this, you need to be careful when using the NOLOCK tabe hint and remember that it is the same as READUNCOMITTED. If you remember this it will remind you that you could end up with a dirty read. If, like I said above, it doesn’t matter if you data is slightly out the using the NOLOCK table hint could be a good way to improve the performance of you database, but be careful when accuracy is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you use NOLOCK in your SQL statements? Are you as careful as you should be?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Outlook.com, Live Mail, Hotmail - Disable the junk filter]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have just started using the new Google Inbox anddecided that it was time to move all of my current emails to fully take advantage of the…]]></description><link>https://hardcopy.dev/outlook-com-email-forwarding/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://hardcopy.dev/outlook-com-email-forwarding/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 14:31:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have just started using the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://inbox.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Inbox&lt;/a&gt; anddecided that it was time to move all of my current emails to fully take advantage of the new offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this I needed to move all of my emails from Outlook.com to Gmail. Simple, you might think - and on the face of it, it is quite simple. I decided to go the POP3 route. That is to say that I connected Gmail to my Outlook.com account via POP3, so that it would download all of my emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then arose, ‘Do I want to leave the emails that Outlook.com has moved to my junk folder?’ Do I trust Microsoft that much? The answer to this question is no. No, I do not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to disable the Outlook.com junk filter to keep all of my emails in the inbox, so that Gmail would retrieve them via POP3. It turned out that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a feature that Outlook.com provides, but while searching for answers, I did stumble across a thread on &lt;a href=&quot;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/osettings-oemailset/is-there-any-way-to-disable-spam-filter-completely/807d742a-a986-4236-95b2-f943e8b527a3?page=1&quot;&gt;answers.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;, which got me some of the way there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution at the time of writing this seemed to be to add the rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;where the senders address contains &amp;quot;@&amp;quot; move it to the inbox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect! And it would be, if Outlook.com would allow you to add this rule. Instead it throws back an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;We can &amp;#39;t save this rule because one or more of your free text inputs is invalid. Hint: Make sure any text with a quotation mark has a pair.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Outlook-Junk-Filter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Oulook Junk Filter Error&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply meaning that you can’t use the @ symbol on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Solution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution I could come up with is to create 2 rules. One that catches all emails that have an attachment and another to catch all emails that don’t have an attachment. Creating these 2 rules should catch any email sent and move it to your inbox. What was strange was that even a rule where you match your email address did not work; surely any email you receive must have been sent to your email address?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should end up with 2 rules that look like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Outlook-Junk-Filter-Rules.png&quot; alt=&quot;Oulook Junk Filter Error&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point all incoming email will match one of the above rules and end up in your inbox, effectively disabling the junk filter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
