title: Setting Up Gatsby

I am moving from a Wordpress site and converting all my old posts. Which is not that many!

I chose Gatsby as I have done a lot of work with React over the past few years.

The whole install process was very straight forward. You will need node and npm. I won't go into details here.

I used the Gatsby Blog Starter [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). This means you can use the following command
````
gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
````
Which will create a new directory (blog) and scaffold out a pretty good blog template.

Then all you need to do is run
````
gatsby develop
````
Which will open up a dev instance on port 8000 by default. [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Happy blogging!
