I did not until just the other day. I normally use <a href=\"https://www.putty.org\">PuTTY</a>, which has always served me well. But it is much easier to use command prompt, especially as I quite often use lots of different machines and I constantly have to re-download PuTTY.</p>\n<p>The syntax is very much as you would expect. So to connect to my router at home I use the following</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ssh root@192.168.0.1</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"2019-02-01-11_05_05-Command-Prompt-ssh-root@192.168.0.1.png\" alt=\"Putty SSH\"></p>\n<p>You can also specify a different port using the -p flag. For example, to connect to my router using port 4567, you would use the following</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ssh root@192.168.0.1 -p 4567</code></pre></div>\n<p>Simple as that, you can now quickly connect to your Linux machines without the need for PuTTY.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SSH in Windows 10","date":"February 01, 2019","description":null},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/mssql-nolock/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MSSQL NOLOCK - my comments and its problems"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/102-status-code-azure/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"You can't use a 102 http status code in Azure"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"556a4136-b719-5dd2-80b3-0eebc6b1e9eb","previousPostId":"26fc2934-d09e-534e-9a22-169a402e9d6a","nextPostId":"5a852d5e-8f9f-505c-8378-a978d63ee932"}},"staticQueryHashes":["20663928","2841359383","916993862"]}
