Specifically it was the “Expression value is never used” warning, which wants you to <em>discard</em> the return value using the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/discards\">_ C# 7.0 discard</a>. It gets annoying not knowing which keyboard shortcut the squiggle wants.\\n\\nSo eventually I found the setting, which is in the ReSharper settings rather than Visual Studio settings.
