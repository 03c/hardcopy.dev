Simple, you might think - and on the face of it, it is quite simple. I decided to go the POP3 route. That is to say that I connected Gmail to my Outlook.com account via POP3, so that it would download all of my emails.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>The question then arose, ‘Do I want to leave the emails that Outlook.com has moved to my junk folder?’ Do I trust Microsoft that much? The answer to this question is no. No, I do not!</p>\n<p>So I decided to disable the Outlook.com junk filter to keep all of my emails in the inbox, so that Gmail would retrieve them via POP3. It turned out that this is <em>not</em> a feature that Outlook.com provides, but while searching for answers, I did stumble across a thread on <a href=\"http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/osettings-oemailset/is-there-any-way-to-disable-spam-filter-completely/807d742a-a986-4236-95b2-f943e8b527a3?page=1\">answers.microsoft.com</a>, which got me some of the way there.</p>\n<p>The best solution at the time of writing this seemed to be to add the rule:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">where the senders address contains &quot;@&quot; move it to the inbox</code></pre></div>\n<p>Perfect! And it would be, if Outlook.com would allow you to add this rule. Instead it throws back an error:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">We can &#39;t save this rule because one or more of your free text inputs is invalid. Hint: Make sure any text with a quotation mark has a pair.</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"Outlook-Junk-Filter.png\" alt=\"Oulook Junk Filter Error\"></p>\n<p>Simply meaning that you can’t use the @ symbol on its own.</p>\n<h1>The Solution</h1>\n<p>The best solution I could come up with is to create 2 rules. One that catches all emails that have an attachment and another to catch all emails that don’t have an attachment. Creating these 2 rules should catch any email sent and move it to your inbox. What was strange was that even a rule where you match your email address did not work; surely any email you receive must have been sent to your email address?</p>\n<p>You should end up with 2 rules that look like the following.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Outlook-Junk-Filter-Rules.png\" alt=\"Oulook Junk Filter Error\"></p>\n<p>At this point all incoming email will match one of the above rules and end up in your inbox, effectively disabling the junk filter.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Outlook.com, Live Mail, Hotmail - Disable the junk filter","date":"November 04, 2014","description":null},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/mssql-nolock/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MSSQL NOLOCK - my comments and its problems"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d838ff8c-52a4-54ed-ab45-4e93fbfe9897","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"26fc2934-d09e-534e-9a22-169a402e9d6a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["20663928","2841359383","916993862"]}
