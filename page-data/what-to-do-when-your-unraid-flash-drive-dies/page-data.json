The only way I knew it had died is that I was missing all the CSS when logging in and there were some strange PHP errors.</p>\n<p>Now the first time, I had no backups of the flash drive at all - yes, I know!</p>\n<p>But I did learn from my mistake and this time I have backups - but this is still a pain!</p>\n<p>The steps to fix are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create new Unraid USB using the Unraid Flash Utility which can be found on the <a href=\"https://unraid.net/download\">Unraid website</a>. Be sure to use the same version you had installed!</li>\n<li>Screenshot the main array page in Unraid if you can.</li>\n<li>Power down and swap the USB drives over.</li>\n<li>Power on.</li>\n<li>Follow the procedure to replace the flash drive found on the <a href=\"https://wiki.unraid.net/UnRAID_6/Changing_The_Flash_Device\">Unraid Wiki</a>. This process will email you a brand new registration key.</li>\n<li>Copy everything in the config folder over to the new USB drive from your backup.</li>\n<li>Restart.</li>\n<li>Here I had to reconfigure the whole array, so use the screenshot from before to make sure it is exactly the same as before.</li>\n<li>Start the array and any services you need.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point you might want to check everything is working as expected. It was a few days before I realized one of my user scripts was not running! Oops!</p>\n<p>I have two Pro keys, which is good because you can only replace your key every 12 months. If I only had one I might be in a pickle</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What to do when your Unraid flash drive dies...","date":"December 17, 2020","description":null},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/setting-up-gatsby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting Up Gatsby"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/rubymine-wsl2-mappings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"RubyMine WSL2 Mappings"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"96b26b52-46d8-5877-b54e-d0fea10eec96","previousPostId":"71d4679b-8352-5dba-be6c-d306c38039bf","nextPostId":"8e0039ad-005b-54a1-87b2-d9a3349d9e9c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["20663928","2841359383","916993862"]}
